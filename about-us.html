          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in the 1970s, our college institution was established with a
            visionary mission to provide high-quality education to students from
            economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Recognizing the barriers to
            academic excellence faced by many due to financial constraints, the
            founders committed to creating an inclusive learning environment
            where financial limitations would not hinder educational attainment.
            Through innovative funding strategies, scholarships, and community
            support, the institution has consistently offered affordable or even
            tuition-free education. Over the decades, it has grown in reputation
            and reach, empowering countless students to achieve their academic
            and professional goals without the burden of financial stress.
